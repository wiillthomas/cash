# Cash

## What is Cash?
![Cash-Logo](https://cdn.clipart.email/6d189a101415d9170937b3253c31fc24_piggy-bank-transparent-background-money-clipart_900-600.jpeg)

## Cash is an in-memory cache for Docker containers, written in Go & designed to be stupidly easy to set up and use.

### Are you looking for a key-value in memory caching solution for your networked containers that:
- Is really fast at low/medium throughput
- Works out of the box with 0 config
- Allows for custom expiration/cleanup times
- Allows purging
- Works over HTTP
- Automatic sharding

### Do you NOT need all those useful features that Redis provides like:
- Storing anything that isnâ€™t a string
- Backups/Restores
- Message brokering
- LRU replacement

<br />

Connection examples for `docker-compose` can be found in the examples folder.

The following enviorment variables can be set for config:

Env Variable | Accepts | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
verbose | Bool | false | Outputs any shards that have values every 2 seconds to the terminal.
expiry | Int | 20 | Default time each item in cache takes to expire - in seconds.
cleanup | Int | 10 | Interval at which the cleanup runs through the cache to find expired items - in seconds.
